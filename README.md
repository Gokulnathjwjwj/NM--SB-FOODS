**Project Title:** SB FOODS - Food Delivery App

**Project Overview:**
- **Objective:** To develop a food delivery application that connects users with local restaurants, allowing them to browse menus, place orders, and track deliveries.
- **Technology Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)

---

**Architecture Overview:**

1. **Frontend (React.js)**
   - **User Interface:** Designed with React components to create a responsive and user-friendly interface.
   - **State Management:** Managed using Redux for efficient handling of application state.
   - **Routing:** Implemented using React Router to navigate between pages like Home, Restaurant List, Menu, Cart, and Order Status.

2. **Backend (Node.js, Express.js)**
   - **API Development:** RESTful APIs created with Express.js to handle CRUD operations for users, restaurants, and orders.
   - **Authentication:** Secure user authentication and authorization implemented using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

3. **Database (MongoDB)**
   - **Data Storage:** MongoDB used for storing user data, restaurant details, menus, and order histories.
   - **Schema Design:** Mongoose ORM for defining schemas and models, ensuring data integrity and ease of querying.

4. **Deployment**
   - **Server:** Hosted on a platform like Heroku or AWS.
   - **Frontend Hosting:** Deployed using services like Netlify or Vercel.
   - **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Automated pipelines for testing and deploying updates.

**Key Features:**
- **User Registration and Login:** Secure sign-up and login for users.
- **Browse and Search Restaurants:** Users can search and browse local restaurants and their menus.
- **Order Placement:** Easy order placement and real-time order tracking.
- **Payment Integration:** Integration with payment gateways for seamless transactions.
- **Admin Panel:** Admin interface for managing restaurants, menus, and orders.

Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide to set up your MERN stack environment for the SB FOODS app:

### Step 1: Install Node.js and npm
1. Visit the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the latest LTS version for your operating system.
2. Follow the installation instructions.
3. Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```
   You should see the versions of Node.js and npm displayed.

### Step 2: Install MongoDB
1. Visit the [MongoDB website](https://www.mongodb.com/) and download the MongoDB Community Edition.
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Verify the installation by running:
   ```bash
   mongo --version
   ```
   This command will display the version of MongoDB installed on your machine.

### Step 3: Set Up Your Project Directory
1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```bash
   mkdir sb-foods-app
   cd sb-foods-app
   ```
2. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```bash
   npm init -y
   ```

### Step 4: Install Express.js
1. Install Express.js by running:
   ```bash
   npm install express
   ```

### Step 5: Create a Basic Express Server
1. Create a file named `app.js` in your project directory and add the following code:
   ```javascript
   const express = require('express');
   const app = express();
   const PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;

   app.get('/', (req, res) => {
       res.send('Hello, World!');
   });

   app.listen(PORT, () => {
       console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);
   });
   ```
2. Run the server:
   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```
   You should see "Server is running on port 3000" in your terminal.

### Step 6: Set Up React
1. Create a React app:
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app client
   cd client
   ```
2. Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will open your app in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Step 7: Connect Frontend to Backend
1. Set up proxy settings in your `package.json` file in the `client` directory:
   ```json
   "proxy": "http://localhost:3000"
   ```
2. Create RESTful APIs in your Express server to handle CRUD operations for users, restaurants, and orders.

### Step 8: Deploy Your App
1. Deploy your backend to a platform like Heroku or AWS.
2. Deploy your frontend to a service like Netlify or Vercel.
